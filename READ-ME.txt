compile css:
"scripts": {
  "compile-scss": "node-sass scss/bootstrap.scss css/main.css"
}
note: scss/bootstrap.scss is the main scss file that will be compiled into main.css

once changes are saved in scss files, run command "npm run compile-scss"

6. (Optional) Watch for changes in SCSS files:

If you want node-sass to automatically compile your SCSS files whenever you make changes, you can use the --watch flag. Update the script in your package.json to:

"scripts": {
  "compile-scss": "node-sass scss/bootstrap.scss css/style.css --watch"
}
